How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It saved a lot of time and effort.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Learn from previous mistakes
see progress

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pro: control
Con: User error

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Files using Git are interrelated, whereas GDocs are seperate entities

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
log shows summary, diff compares

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because you can always go back to older versions and fix them
